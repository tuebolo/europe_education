Analysis of education statistics across several European countries.

Data was obtained from a Kaggle dataset created by Gabriel Preda (https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/population-by-education-level-in-europe).
The dataset provides education attainment level grouped by age group, sex and geotime in Europe. 
Original source is https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database (official European Data Source).

The purpose of this project was to clean and analyse this data set to provide insights into the trend of education between different European countries across different sexes.

An hypothesis that was tested was to ascertain whether significantly more women attended univerty across the whole of Europe in 2020 compared to 2010.
A Mann Whitney test was conducted to compare the two variables and it was found that there was a non-significant increase in women attending university in 2020 when compared to 2010.
